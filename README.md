# Arizona Digital Review Site

This repository contains the CloudFormation template to deploy the infrastructure
required to host the Arizona Digital review site over HTTPS.

- After deploy, add pipeline IAM users to the IAM group generated by this stack

## Teardown
- Delete everything from the S3 bucket
